# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. 
# This can be done with casting. 
# Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
x = int(1)   # int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
y = float(2.8)   # float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
z = str(3.0)  # str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals.
