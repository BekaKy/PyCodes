# There are three numeric types in Python:

#   int
#   float
#   complex

x = 1    # Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
y = 2.8  # Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
z = 1j   # Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.

# To print a random number, we have to import the random module:
import random
# Now we use random.randrange(a, b) function in order to get random number in range from a to b
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
