# Python allows you to create functions that return a boolean value
def boolfunc() :
  return True

print(boolfunc())

# Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value
# like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
x = 100
print(isinstance(x, int))
