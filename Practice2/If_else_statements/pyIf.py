# Python Conditions and If statements

# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

#     Equals: a == b
#     Not Equals: a != b
#     Less than: a < b
#     Less than or equal to: a <= b
#     Greater than: a > b
#     Greater than or equal to: a >= b
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

# -------
number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("The number is positive")
