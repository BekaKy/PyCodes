# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
# The & operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if both are 1, otherwise it is set to 0:
print(6 & 3)

# The | operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if one or both is 1, otherwise it is set to 0:
print(6 | 3)

# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:
print(6 ^ 3)
