# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
# Ordered

# When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# Unchangeable

# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
# Allow Duplicates

# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
